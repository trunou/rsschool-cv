### Summary
I had been working as the Head of information department in a trading and e-commerce company for about 8 years. Now I'm an individual entrepreneur involved in planning and hosting events. I’d like to change it and have more location-independent lifestyle that would allow/enable me to be more flexible in terms of dealing with external circumstances and life situations.
I’m also excited about getting back to web development and hope to grow fast in this sphere.
